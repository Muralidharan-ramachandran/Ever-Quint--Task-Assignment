# 🧠 Multi‑Step Reasoning Agent with Self‑Checking

A small but robust Gen‑AI agent that solves structured word problems step‑by‑step, verifies its own work, and returns a clean JSON answer object to the user. 
---

## ✨ Project Overview

This project implements a **planner–executor–verifier** loop for math, logic, and constraint‑style word problems.
The agent hides long chain‑of‑thought from the end user while still using it internally for planning, execution, and self‑checks.

---

## 🎯 Problem Domain

The agent handles short, structured word problems such as:

- Time differences  
- Simple arithmetic story problems  
- Scheduling / constraint satisfaction questions
